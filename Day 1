Mount the sensors on the bowl and dispenser, integrate LED on the sensor
Code for arduio getting the reedings from scale body sensor using HX711 
#include <HX711_ADC.h>

// Define the HX711 object
HX711_ADC LoadCell;

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(115200);
  LoadCell.begin();

  // Set the calibration factor for your load cells
  LoadCell.set_scale();
  LoadCell.tare();
}

void loop() {
  if (LoadCell.update()) {
    // Read the weight in grams
    float weight = LoadCell.getData();
    Serial.print("Weight (g): ");
    Serial.println(weight);
  }
delay(1000); // Update weight every second


##Steps to follow
1. Mount the sensors on the bowl and dispenser.
2. Mount the LED on the bowl.
3. Write the code for Arduino to get the readings from the scale body sensor on the bowl and dispenser using HX711.

##Code Explanation

This code helps with the physical connection of the project. After the scale body sensor has been mounted on the bowl and the dispenser,
The code allows us to collect the weight data from the sensors. The LED has been integrated in the circuit to indicate low food levels in the bowl.
This component helps improve the project.
