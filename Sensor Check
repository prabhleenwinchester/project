Include Library: Include the HX711 library at the beginning of the code. This library enables you to work with the HX711 load cell amplifier.

Initialize the Scale: In the setup() function, initialize a HX711 object named scale. Use the begin() method to specify the pins connected to the DT (data) and SCK (clock) pins of the HX711.

Serial Communication: Set up the serial communication with a baud rate of 9600. This is useful for debugging and displaying information on the Arduino Serial Monitor.

Sensor Check Loop: The loop() function is where the main logic of your program resides. It continuously checks the status of the sensor and reads weight data.

Check Sensor Status: The if statement checks if the sensor is ready. If it is, it prints "Sensor is connected."

Read Weight: Use the get_units() method to read the weight from the sensor. The 10 argument specifies that it should average 10 readings for a more stable result.

Print Weight: The weight value is printed to the Serial Monitor in grams.

Sensor Not Found: If the sensor is not ready, it prints "Sensor not found. Check your connections."

Delay: There's a 2-min delay using delay(120000), which prevents the program from flooding the Serial Monitor with data. You can adjust the delay as needed
